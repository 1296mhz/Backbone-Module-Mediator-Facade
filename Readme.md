# A Backbone JS implimentation of the Module, Mediator, Facade

Module, Mediator, Facade is a javascript design pattern that helps decouple application modules.

I built this boilerplate to experiment and learn the module mediator facade pattern.

You can read more about it [here](http://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/), this is also largly based off of Addy Osmani's [Backbone Aura](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-aura) project.

This is still a work in progess
